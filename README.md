* Version: 0.4.0
* Scenarios: 0 playable out of 0 planned.
* Medals earnable: 0

Nobody controls the high seas. Privateers and petty navies fight over paradise; many a good man seeks his fortune in the wealth of plundered goods stolen from islands and mainlands, hidden in coves for a day of celebration that may never come. Can one band of mercenary pirates hold together long enough to find a happy ending?

Though this campaign features a single difficulty level, there is opportunity for extra challenge in completing some alternative objectives or actions. These will award you with medals of recognition at the end of the campaign.
